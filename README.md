# Custom Agent with LlamaIndex

## What is an AI Agent?

> By themselves, language models can't take actions â€” they just output text.
> Agents are systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines to determine which actions to take and the inputs to pass
> them. After executing actions, the results can be fed back into the LLM to determine whether more actions are needed,
> or
> whether it is okay to finish.
